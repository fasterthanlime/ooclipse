ooclipse: ooc Eclipse plug-in
=============================

Still very basic, but does a pretty good job at syntaxic coloration
(thanks to SWT/JFace/Eclipse's excellent toolkits).

Feel free to contribute content assist, etc. =)

Originally based on the XML Editor example, so there may be rests
of the example in the code.
